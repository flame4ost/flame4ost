### Hi there 👋



Here are some ideas to get you started:

💡  I like to explore new technologies and develop software solutions and quick hacks.
🎓  I'm currently studying Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
🌱  I'm on track for learning more about Artificial Intelligence, Systems Design, Android Development and Cloud Architecture.
✍️  In my free time, I pursue Graphic Design and App for Android as hobbies/side hustles.
💬  Feel free to reach out to me for pro bono consulting and volunteering, or just for some interesting discussion.
✉️  You can shoot me an email at huanmastak@gmail.com! I'll try to respond as soon as I can.
